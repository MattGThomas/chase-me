              Chase Me If You Can is where passion and creativity come together
              to make your vision a reality.

              <br />
              After pursuing a Bachelor’s in Electronic Media from Wichita State
              University, I discovered that visuals and cinematics were where my
              main interests lie. I’ve been casually making videos for years and
              moved onto more professional videography and audiovisual services
              in 2016. <br />
              <br />
              Since beginning my career, I have completed multiple mass media
              projects and jobs including photo shoots, podcasts, short films,
              music videos, live streams, skits, and more. I recently added a
              drone to my arsenal, which allows me to record from even more
              heights and angles. <br />
              <br />
              These days I am pursuing my Master’s in Multimedia Videography at
              Wichita State, while also teaching Public Speaking there as well.
              However, in my spare I enjoy a variety of activities including
              working out, anime, watching movies, and capturing candid moments
              with my camera. It’s my own personal interests that drove me to
              start passion projects like{" "}
              <Link to="/hero-101">
                <span style={{ color: "red" }}>HERO 101</span>
              </Link>
              , which would eventually blossom into starting my own business.{" "}
